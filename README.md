# Module 5 Challenge: Pymaceuticals

## Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize data from a study comparing the effectiveness of various drug regimens in treating squamous cell carcinoma (a type of skin cancer) in mice. Using Python, I am tasked to conduct statistical analysis and create compelling visualizations to present my findings.

## Objectives
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Clean and organize the dataset for analysis.
2. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Perform descriptive statistics on the study results.
   - Use inferential statistics to compare the effectiveness of different drug regimens.
3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Create plots such as scatter plots, box-and-whisker plots, and bar charts to communicate results effectively.
4. **Key Insights**:
   - Identify trends, such as which drug regimen performed best or how tumor volume correlated with factors like weight.

## Deliverables
- Python scripts for data analysis and visualization.
- Graphs and charts presenting the study results.
- Statistical insights derived from the analysis.
